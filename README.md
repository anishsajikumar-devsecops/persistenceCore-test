<h1 align="center">PersistenceCore-1: Revolutionizing Liquid Staking üååüöÄ</h1>

![Persistence Core](https://blog.persistence.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Full_Logo_Light.png)

**PersistenceCore** is at the heart of the Persistence ecosystem, utilizing the power of Tendermint for blockchain consensus. Our vision is to bridge various blockchain networks, facilitating a unified ecosystem for liquid staking and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. By enabling assets to flow freely across blockchains, we aim to unlock new possibilities for asset utilization and yield generation.

## üöÄ What Makes Persistence Core Unique?

- **Liquid Staking** üîì: We allow users to mint stkASSETs through [pSTAKE](https://pStake.finance), providing a way to earn rewards on staked assets while still participating in the broader DeFi ecosystem. This means you can have your assets work double-time for you‚Äîstaking rewards plus DeFi yields. Learn more about [Liquid Staking](https://docs.pstake.finance/).
- **CosmWasm Integration** üß©: Our platform leverages [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) for smart contract functionality, making it possible for developers to build and deploy complex DeFi applications with ease. This opens up a world of possibilities for creating interoperable applications that can communicate across different blockchains. Discover the potential of [CosmWasm](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/).
- **Cross-Chain Functionality** üåâ: The core feature of Persistence is its ability to support assets from various blockchains like Ethereum and Polkadot, enhancing liquidity and connectivity between different ecosystems. This is crucial for the seamless exchange of value and information across networks. Dive into [Cross-Chain Functionality](https://docs.persistence.one/).
- **On-Chain Governance** üó≥Ô∏è: At Persistence, we believe in decentralized decision-making. XPRT holders have the power to vote on proposals, guiding the evolution of the ecosystem. This democratic approach ensures that the community's voice is heard and that the platform evolves in a direction that benefits all stakeholders.

## üåç Ecosystem Highlights

- **[pSTAKE Finance](https://pStake.finance)**: A groundbreaking platform that unlocks the liquidity of staked assets. With pSTAKE, users can stake their assets and receive stkASSETs in return, which can then be used across various DeFi protocols to earn additional yields.
- **[AUDIT.one](https://audit.one)**: Our staking service that provides security and operational efficiency for proof-of-stake (PoS) networks. By ensuring the integrity and reliability of network validators, AUDIT.one plays a critical role in maintaining the health and security of the blockchain ecosystem.
- **DEXter**: An innovative decentralized exchange (DEX) that facilitates the trading of assets between different blockchains. By providing a platform for interchain liquidity, DEXter aims to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of DeFi markets.

## üíª Hardware Requirements

Whether you're just getting started or setting up a production environment, here's what you'll need:

- **Minimal Setup**

  - üóÉÔ∏è **RAM**: 1 GB
  - üíæ **HDD**: 25 GB
  - üñ•Ô∏è **CPU**: 1.4 GHz
- **Recommended Setup**

  - üóÉÔ∏è **RAM**: 2 GB
  - üíæ **HDD**: 100 GB
  - üñ•Ô∏è **CPU**: 2.0 GHz x2

> üö® **Note**: üöÄ SSDs, while faster, have limited TBW (Total Bytes Written) and can deteriorate quickly under the load of running a full node, which requires significant data writing activities.

## üñ• Operating System Compatibility

Ensuring your system runs smoothly with persistenceCore:

- **Supported Operating Systems**

  - üêß **Linux** (x86)
  - üçè **MacOS** (x86)
- **Recommended for Optimal Performance**

  - üêß **Linux** (x86_64) - Leveraging the full potential of Linux for stability and performance.
